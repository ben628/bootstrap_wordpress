bootstrap_wordpress
===================

#### Bootstrap based Wordpress Parent Theme ####

Bootstrap is a fantastic launch point for any HTML5/CSS3 project.  bootstrap_wordpress is simply bootstrap repackaged as a Wordpress Parent Theme.  It has been tested in Wordpress 3.5, but will probably work for both older and newer versions.

Using bootstrap_wordpress
-------------------------

Download the latest version of the repository, and place the bootstrap and bootstrap-child folders into your theme folder in your Wordpress install.

Rename bootstrap-child to the name of your new theme, and edit style.css and update the header information - specifically the Theme name/url and the Author information.

Activate the new child theme in Wordpress, and start modifying it to meet your needs.  Keep in mind that the purpose of this theme is not Wordpress bells and whistles, but rather a very clean theme that includes Bootstrap and Responsive functionality.  If you are looking for a full featured theme, you probably want to look somewhere else.
